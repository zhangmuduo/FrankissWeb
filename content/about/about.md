Hello, I'm Forest, a first-year Ph.D. student working under the mentorship of Professor Yao Guo. 
My research is deeply rooted in the fascinating fields of temporal grounding and object tracking in egocentric videos. 
This niche, while technically challenging, has a profound purpose: to aid individuals suffering from Alzheimer's disease.

I hold both a bachelor's and master's degree in Biomedical Engineering from the prestigious Imperial College London. 
Currently, I'm continuing my academic journey at Shanghai Jiaotong University. 
My work lies at the intersection of technology and healthcare, 
aiming to create solutions that enhance the quality of life for those affected by cognitive impairments.

If you share a passion for innovative healthcare technologies or are interested in the applications of video analysis in medical contexts, 
I would be delighted to connect and exchange ideas. Let's collaborate to make a meaningful impact in the realm of health and technology!
