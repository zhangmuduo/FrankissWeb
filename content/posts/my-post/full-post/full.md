The activity aims to introduce the memory-related problems experienced by patients with Alzheimer's disease, especially episodic memory loss. The rationale behind choosing this topic is the growing population of patients who have Alzheimer's disease and the lack of professional carers in their daily lives. To solve this difficult situation, we developed a deep learning-based model, which records the patient's everyday life using egocentric cameras mounted on the forehead or in front of the chest. When the patients propose a question using natural language, querying about their memory, the model can locate the video segment containing the answer. 

We will construct the activity in the following parts:
1. Introductory

At the beginning of the activity, a brief talk will be delivered on the current situation of Alzheimer's disease and the definition of episodic memory. We could add an interactive section to make this part easy to understand. We will ask the participants about details of their daily activities earlier to clarify the definition.

2. Hands-on experimentation

After the introductory section, a hands-on experiment section will be held to address further the significance of our model in assisting patients with Alzheimer's disease. We will ask the participants to wear an egocentric camera mounted on a helmet and provide them with a card with a short list of everyday activities. Within the given area, the participants will perform the assigned activities, and the camera will record the same vision of them in the meantime. When the activities are accomplished, the participants will be queried about some details according to the video without referring to it. (e.g., 'How many XX can be seen on XX?' and 'What is the colour of XX?') At the same time, the questions, together with the video, will be inputted into our model. The performance of both the participants and our model will be scored and compared to indicate the ability of our model.

3. Mechanism explanation

In the following section, we will briefly introduce the working mechanism of our model. This part could also be integrated into an AI and cognitive sciences module. The activity offers a practical, real-world application of theoretical concepts taught in computer vision courses.

4. Risks and ethics

At the beginning of the hands-on session, the participants will be informed of the usage of the video, and we will ensure compliance with data protection laws and ethical guidelines. The videos will only used for the activity and will be deleted afterwards. In addition, moving and performing tasks wearing egocentric cameras could be challenging since the helmet might block the participants' sightseeing and lead to accidents. To prevent this situation, we will try to deliver detailed instructions, and the participants will also have a trial section under our supervision.
