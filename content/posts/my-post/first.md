Alzheimer’s disease, a condition that slowly erases cherished memories and daily routines, affects millions worldwide. As we face a rising number of individuals living with this condition, the question looms: how can we ease their daily struggles and provide assistance outside of the hospital? Our answer lies in the capability of deep learning models and the innovative use of egocentric cameras.

Imagine a tool so intuitive that it becomes an extension of oneself, a tool that not only observes daily life but also assists in recalling the simplest things - like where one left their keys. This model is the heart of our project: a deep learning-based episodic memory assistant meticulously designed to support those suffering from Alzheimer’s.

In our interactive session, you will experience the world as they do. You’ll capture every day yet significant moments of your day by wearing an egocentric camera. These moments, often overlooked, are crucial for someone with Alzheimer’s. You’ll perform everyday tasks, and later, our model will challenge you to recall details - a simple test that mirrors the daily reality of an Alzheimer’s patient.

But this is more than just a demonstration of the technology. We delve into the mechanics of this AI model, exploring how it interprets, learns, and assists. We address the pressing questions: How does this technology work? Can it truly improve the quality of life for those with memory impairments?

Join us in this unique, empathetic journey. Together, we’ll not only understand the challenges faced by those with Alzheimer’s but also witness how technology can offer a helping hand in their moments of uncertainty. “Unlocking Memories” is more than a presentation; it’s a window into a future where technology and compassion intertwine to create a world more understanding and accessible for all.
