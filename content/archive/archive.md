This section is dedicated to showcasing my academic and research publications. While it currently stands empty, 
I am diligently working towards contributing valuable insights and breakthroughs in my field. 
My commitment to advancing the understanding of temporal grounding and object tracking in egocentric videos, 
particularly for aiding individuals with Alzheimer's disease, is unwavering.

I am actively engaged in research and collaborations, aiming to produce work that merits publication. 
This space will soon reflect the fruits of my labor and dedication to biomedical engineering and its application in improving healthcare outcomes. 
Stay tuned for updates on my contributions to academic literature!
